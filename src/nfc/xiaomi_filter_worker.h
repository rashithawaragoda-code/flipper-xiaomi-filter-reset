/**
 * @file xiaomi_filter_worker.h
 * @brief NFC worker that authenticates a Xiaomi filter tag and clears its counter.
 *
 * The worker drives a custom MfUltralight (NTAG213) poller state machine in the
 * NFC worker thread. On each detected tag it:
 *   1. reads the UID (pages 0-1, unprotected),
 *   2. derives the tag password from the UID,
 *   3. authenticates with PWD_AUTH,
 *   4. reads the product id and current usage counter (for reporting),
 *   5. writes zeros to the counter page (page 8) to reset filter life to 100%,
 *   6. reads the page back and verifies it is zero.
 *
 * A single successful authentication is the definitive signal that the presented
 * tag is a genuine Xiaomi filter, because the password is a deterministic function
 * of that specific tag's UID. The worker never writes unless authentication
 * succeeds, so a foreign tag is left untouched.
